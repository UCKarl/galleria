I"w<p>This is my first attempt at wood burning, using the Weller pyrography kit that I got for around $20 at Home Depot. Search YouTube for the unboxing of the Weller kit for some fun results. There’s a pin that connects the lid of the box to the base. It took me a few days to figure out how to open the box, and finally, Amanda figured it out simply by breaking the pin with the end of a hammer. The reddit solutions were to jam a screwdriver into the pin, but if you know you’re going to keep the kit, I’d advise just busting it off. It suffices to say if you’re having a hard time opening the box, you’re not alone.</p>
