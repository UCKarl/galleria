This is my first attempt at wood burning, using the Webber pyrography kit.

The first piece of advice before you take any piece of wood is make sure to sand the surface to eliminate the grain. If you were like myself and didn't happen to do that, some wood burning equipment actually cuts into the wood.

You'll notice that the lamp is dotted. This is because it's against the grain. Some parts of the wood are much thicker than other parts.


The Weller kit doesn't actually have a tip that would cut through the wood while burning. It, however, has an exacto knife tip that you can use to *first* cut and then burn in on the cut.

I decided to add a bit more detail, like the train station. In the background, Amanda thought that the building was a hill.
